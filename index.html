			  I was born in Dammam city of beautiful Saudia Arabia ("ana kalim Arabi shawiya shawiya"). I lived in Saudia Arabia for good 11 years. After this amazing life I moved to Lahore city of Pakistan to persue my Matriculation from English Grammar School .During this time of my life i got intreiged with computers and decideed to study Computer Science so I did my Intermediate Studies in Computer Science (I.C.S) from Punjab Group Of Colleges Lahore . During this phase of my life I learned that I am actually quite good in some computer games so I started to play Counter Strike and within a two years I was ranked in top players in whole Pakistan so I stoped studying and started to playing seriously to become the best player in Pakistan due to the respect and fame I was getting in Pakistan. I opened a Gaming Zone named "FATALITY" and was having success but suddenly the amount of loadsheding and costs became high and I lost everything so I decided to go back to education.<br><br>

			  Coming back to the good part I got the admission in University Of Tuebingen and this was a dream come true. Now I am Studying Computation Linguistics. You might be wondering why computer linguistics so there are two reasons <br>
			  1) Computer Science was in German.<br>
			  2) Ever wonder which was the very first language spoken by the people.<br>
			  Exactly, Here you go I hope now I am not making you think about start studying again or change ur field if you are almost done.
			  <br><br>
			  Currently I am studying about Finite State Transducers as my Thesis Implementing and improving 	
			  <br><br>	
			  Looking back at my life the failure I suffered taught me study is the only thing which can help you in a long run and now I know what failiur feels like and never want to experience it again. Now I am almost done with my degree and hopefully will have a stable job now .

			  Damn it was a rollercoaster ride
